# note: the following variables are currently defined in
# Infrastructure/ansible/playbooks/group_vars/container_service_host.yml but
# they belong in the group_vars folder alongside the inventory (i.e. in
# UCLMedicalImagingEnv). The Infrastructure repo should not have knowledge about
# how the groups are named in the inventory. In fact the group being targeted in
# a play should be passed as a variable when running the `ansible-playbook`
# command.
